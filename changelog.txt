0.0.1 Conception

General:
-- Created a fork of the original project

Gameplay:
-- Changed the way player costs are calculated to be determined by their stats, including stamina.

Optimization:
-- Reduced the maximum speed by 80%, but increased the rate that game time passes by 500%.  Realtime, matches should be the same, but it should require far less CPU work.

UI/UX:
-- Removed the title from the header, and started adding information displays in its place.
-- Widened the Active Team display a bit so it only takes two rows, and made the Reserve Roster always 'up'
-- Added displays for each team's ATT and DEF in the Division table.
-- Added Current Match info to the League Tab, as part of an effort to reclaim some empty screen space.  Match screen will be getting yeeted eventually.
-- Started condensing stuff in the Settings Tab.
-- Fixed up the Links section of Settings to credit Vepro for their original work.
